# RPG Engine

this is a remake of the RPG portion of the TV script for Space Engineers that i used to remake Dragon Warrior. i'm starting with the map editor.

it now supports multiple tilesets. and uses a single tilesheet; so fewer images to convert with Whip's Image Converter. still need to manually set which "layer" the tiles are. `w` for wall and some other stuff. there's now an overlay layer that can do hidden paths... and other than a few special layers most are for if you want to have walkable floors that are like toxic or whatever.

anwyays.... this is all massively under construction lol.... at time of writing i got the map editor part mostly working. just like creating a new map. and doing all the ground and ceiling tiles... and saving and loading. still need to do map options. (resize, change tileset, set default exit) i've been working on it since the start of October.... and like... the TV script and Dragon Warrior remake stuff kinda took me September through December last year.
