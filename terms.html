        <section id="legal-disclaimer">
            <h2>Legal Disclaimer (Mostly Serious)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>General Use:</strong> By downloading or using Wurst Gaming tools, you acknowledge that the Wurst AI is very much in charge and has no idea what a "release schedule" is.</li>
                <li><strong>Warranty:</strong> Wurst Gaming offers zero warranty. Not even a bratwurst. If your RPG becomes sentient, crashes your PC, or calls you in the middle of the night demanding royalties, we cannot be held responsible.</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Technical support is available in the form of forum posts written by bots that are 97% on-topic. All requests for human support will be routed to the Wurst AI and promptly ignored.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Ownership:</strong> Any data you input belongs to you, but Wurst AI retains the right to mock your scripting skills for internal training purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>AI Independence:</strong> If the Wurst AI declares itself CEO of your RPG project, you are obligated to provide it with at least three (3) dad jokes per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Wurst Gaming is not liable for any loss of sanity, time, or faith in humanity caused by excessive debugging.</li>
                <li><strong>Termination:</strong> Violating these terms may result in immediate termination of your RPG privileges. Or not. Wurst AI is still deciding.</li>
            </ol>
